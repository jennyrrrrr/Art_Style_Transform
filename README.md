### GAN!

### Proposal:

The greatest painters left amazing art works to us, and we are still admiring their art and style until today. 

It would amazing if we can replicate the same style from them. 

And you can easily turn any photographies you like into the same Monet or Van Gogh yourself. 


### Goals:
Train a Clycle GAN model, input photographies, output Monet Style Paintings. 


### Dataset:

1. Monet Paintings

2. Van Gogh Paintings

3. photographies

### Reference


### Abstract - in a paragraph or two, summarize the project

The project is to produce perform image to image transformatioin, intended in creating Monet styled paintings by training generative adversarial networks. 

### Problem statement - what are you trying to solve/do

In training image to a different style, usually needs paired data for training, 

but in some cases, we dont have paired data. 

The problem statement is how can we generatae image without having paired data. 
for example, if we want to transforem a real life photograohy to a van goph styled painting, we can get eal life photograohy to a van goph styled painting, but these images can not be paired.  

### Related work - what papers/ideas inspired you, what datasets did you use, etc

I referenced the codes and notbooks on kaggle. 

Cycled GAN Paper:

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf

I'm using the data from the Monet data set on Kaggle. 

To try on a more dramatic and different style from the , I also tried the skechtings from van gogh's paintings. 

### Methodology - what is your approach/solution/what did you do?
Experiments/evaluation - how are you evaluating your results

in the paper for cycle GAN, the authors are able to transform horse to zebra, and transform zebra back to horse, or transform the real life photographies to a certain art style. 


in this case, we are transofmring data from domain x to domain y. 
and we need a distriminator to jude if the generated image belongs to domain y. 

using only the discriminator may cause problems like generating images that look like it's a image in domain y, but the generated image may turned out to have nothing in relation with the input image. 

so to avid problem like this 

we need another generate to transform the image from domain y back to image in domain x. 

and we need to make the regenerated input image to be as close as to the original input image. 

so we need another cycle gan that do the reverse work. 


there are two generator and two discriminator.

Results - How well did you do

The model is successful in making monet styled painting from real life photographies.
